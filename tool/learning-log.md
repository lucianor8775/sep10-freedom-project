## Tool: **A-frame**

* Website and video I used
[A-frame tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWO-nWWe5w) + [A-frame website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/)
     * These reasorces helped me learn more about A-frame and they also helped me with coding my cabin.
* I looked up examples and tinkered with the code and I ended up creating a forest with a cabin(its on my blog, sorry for submitting late.)
  This is the code that I came up with in order to make the cabin.
  ```bash
  <a-box position="0 0 -3" width="4" height="0.1" depth="3" color="#8B4513"></a-box>
  <a-box position="-2 1 -3" width="0.1" height="2" depth="3" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="2 1 -3" width="0.1" height="2" depth="3" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="0 1 -4.5 -3" width="4" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="0 1 -1.5" width="4" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-cone position="0 3.5 -3" radius-bottom="3" radius-top="0" height="3" color="#A52A2A"></a-cone>
  <a-box position="0 0.5 -1.4" width="1" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#8B4513"></a-box>
  ```
* A few challenges that I have faced while tinkering was the alignment of the objects that I was creating, and finding good examples that I can take inspo from.
  * I fixed the alignment of my objects by trying every possible number that I could untill I eventually got it correct.
* Question: How do i get textures on A-frame??
* I plan to learn how to make my code look more realistic and I want to learn how to align my objects better.
  * I want to apply what i have learned by including a VR immersion on my freedom project.
