# Entry 2: next steps
##### 10/4/2024

### Context
I am a student at HSAT and i ampreparing to begin the freedom project in my SEP class. the freedom project is year long project i am going to be working on that show cases a lot about my topic (astronomy). since my first blog i have been doing a lot of research about the different types of technology that is used in the field of astronomy. i have learned a lot about the different types of apps and programs that astronomy have an example of this is the world wide telescope. the world wide telescope is a website that allows the user access to a lot of images that space probes take of celestial objects.

### Content
a few of the apps i found include [solar walk](https://vitotechnology.com/apps/solar-walk), [starry night](https://www.starrynight.com/starry-night-8-professional-astronomy-telescope-control-software.html), and, [skyview](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skyview-lite/id413936865). i found these apps by searching "what type of apps do people in astronomy use?" and "astronomy apps". Solar Walk is a 3D planetarium in your device that has a model of the Solar system that shows you the planets, satellites, and other space objects. the user can navigate through space and see all the planets close-up, and you can also learn their trajectories, composition, surface temperature, and so much more. starry night is a software that uses OpenGL and Quick Time to show a photo realistic night sky. It also provides telescope control. Skyview costs 1.99 and has a free version available, it has little telescope control an AR star map, easily accessible info, the constellation art fades too quickly, and it is not as detailed as other apps, but it is avaliable on the app store and can be used on mobile.


### sources
a lot of sources that i have used include:
*(astronomy software)[https://astronomyonline.org/AstronomySoftware.asp], astronomy software is a website that includes a lot of different software programs and apps, the website also includes a lot of information about the apps.
