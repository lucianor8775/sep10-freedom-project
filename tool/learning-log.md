## Tool: **A-frame**

### 3/9/2025
* Website and video I used
[A-frame tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWO-nWWe5w) + [A-frame website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/)
     * These reasorces helped me learn more about A-frame and they also helped me with coding my cabin.
* I looked up examples and tinkered with the code and I ended up creating a forest with a cabin(its on my blog, sorry for submitting late.)
  This is the code that I came up with in order to make the cabin.
  ```bash
  <a-box position="0 0 -3" width="4" height="0.1" depth="3" color="#8B4513"></a-box>
  <a-box position="-2 1 -3" width="0.1" height="2" depth="3" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="2 1 -3" width="0.1" height="2" depth="3" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="0 1 -4.5 -3" width="4" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="0 1 -1.5" width="4" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-cone position="0 3.5 -3" radius-bottom="3" radius-top="0" height="3" color="#A52A2A"></a-cone>
  <a-box position="0 0.5 -1.4" width="1" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#8B4513"></a-box>
  ```
* A few challenges that I have faced while tinkering was the alignment of the objects that I was creating, and finding good examples that I can take inspo from.
  * I fixed the alignment of my objects by trying every possible number that I could untill I eventually got it correct.
* Question: How do i get textures on A-frame??
* I plan to learn how to make my code look more realistic and I want to learn how to align my objects better.
  * I want to apply what i have learned by including a VR immersion on my freedom project.

#### A few resources that ive used include

* [build a carnival shooting game in A-Frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Hou5QsRiE)+[A-Frame website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/)

#### Stuff ive done/progress ive made

* I tried to remake the the game that the guy made in the video but i wasnt able to make it look like the video exactly. I made progress by trying to remake things shown on video.
  
#### Challenges

* A few challenges that i have faced was while trying to recreate the things shown on the video, when i had to change a few things about the code so that i could make it a bit more different and add my own twist on it.
  
#### Questions

* is there a limit to what i can build on A-Frame?
* will we have any other chances to practice A-Frame in class?
 
#### Things i will be trying next

* making games on my own
* new unfamiliar code

  #### Resources
  
  * [Aframe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mETucqeOmXA&list=PLP3KjR1TMw7ekqC4o5gy0rR4odw7Jga84&index=3)+[Aframe website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/)

  #### Progress Made

 * I added my own texture in my code and made it look like the nightsky. I also tinked using the examples shown on the youtube video. My main focus was getting textures on my code since that has been my goal since the begining.

 * ```bash
     <a-assets>
    <img id="ground" src="ground.jpg">
     </a-assets>
   ``` 

  * This is the code for adding textures in your scene

  #### Challenges

 * When I tried to add textures it wouldnt work at first because I wasnt using the correct type of link.

  #### Questions

  * I want to learn how to add audio in my code
  * I want to learn to make a firework scene

  #### Next Steps

  * My next steps will be to make a scene with builds, textures, and audio. I hope to make my gameplay as immersive as possible and I want to make it enjoyable and playable for everyone.
