### choosing a topic
the topic that i chose for the freedom project is astronomy, i chose astronomy because it is something that i have always found very facinating,interesting, and has been something that i have always liked learning about. beforing making up my mind on the my topic i had two other chocies, these two other chocies were law and philosophy. a website that made me consider doing law as my project topic is https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/the-law.page because it has a lot of information on NewYork state law. a website that made  me consider doing philiosophy as my topic is https://philindex.org/about-us/ because it has publications from philiosophers that date back to the early 1900Â´s and because the publications come from many different countries and languages. overall these websites were all very intersting but i ended up choosing astronomy because of the https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/astronomy/what-is-astronomy website. the reason i found this website so interesting and chose astronomy as my topic is because this website teaches a lot about astronomy and it is very interavctive and fun.
