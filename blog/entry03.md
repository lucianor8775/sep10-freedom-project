 ### Content 
I have written and done my research on my project topic. **My project will be about an immersion experience** that includes an app that has all information available about space using a kind of software that gives the user access to all the databases/information about space ever recorded. I brainstormed part B of my project by adding the big ideas, being my astronomy space room and then i wrote multiple small details that my main idea will have. I finalized all of my content so that it is realy for my website by organizing all of my notes and categorizing them based on the most information that i can get.

 ### Sources 
In order to find and gather all my information i had to use multiple sources so that i could build both my part A and part B of my notes. these where my sources:
* [NASA](nasa.gov)
* [Space.com](https://www.space.com/best-stargazing-apps)
* [astronomyonline](https://astronomyonline.org/AstronomySoftware.asp)
* [google](google)

### Engineering Design Process
I am currently finishing up my research for this project. The next step that i must take in my engineering design process is to use all of my organized notes and my research to work on creating the bigger picture that being a prototype of my invention as well as a description on how my invention and how everything will work in my app/immersion experience.

### Skills 
a few skills that i learned after starting this project where, **learning how to google, time management, and organization.**

#### Googling
**learning how to google** was a very esential skill that i picked up while doing this project, and it was very helpful when it came time to do research, learning how to google has helped me a lot with this project as well as outside this projrct because it tought me to use key words in my searches in order to get the reseults that i needed.

#### Time managment
**time management** is another skill that helped me while working on the freedom project, it has helped me with setting time aside in order to do research, this skill also helped me in some of my other classes because it has helped me with setting time aside in order to study and catch up on work that i have misssed.

#### Organization
**Organization** is another skill that has helped me in this project as well as in some of my other clases because it has helped me with organizing my research notes on my topic but as well as organizing my work and my other notes in class.
