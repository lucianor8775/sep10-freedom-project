[A-frame tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWO-nWWe5w) + [A-frame website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/)
* I looked up examples and tinkered with the code and i ended up creating a forest with a cabin(its on my blog, sorry for submitting late.)
  this is the code that i came up with in order to make the cabin
  ```bash
  <a-box position="0 0 -3" width="4" height="0.1" depth="3" color="#8B4513"></a-box>
  <a-box position="-2 1 -3" width="0.1" height="2" depth="3" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="2 1 -3" width="0.1" height="2" depth="3" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="0 1 -4.5 -3" width="4" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-box position="0 1 -1.5" width="4" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
  <a-cone position="0 3.5 -3" radius-bottom="3" radius-top="0" height="3" color="#A52A2A"></a-cone>
  <a-box position="0 0.5 -1.4" width="1" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#8B4513"></a-box>
  ```
* a few challenges that i have faced while tinkering was the alignment of the objescts that i was creating, and finding good examples that i can take inspo from.
* How do i get textures on A-frame??
* I plan to learn how to make my code look more realistic and i want to learn how to align my objects better.
