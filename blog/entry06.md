## Content
I made my MVP by looking at the website requirements and my Wire frames. I had the idea to add a carousel, cards and a collapse but i did not arrange them the same way i had it on my wireframe because i realized that i wanted to add more last minute. A few takeawys i had while making my MVP were that i should view the requirements before making the wireframe to make sure the layout of your website makes sense, and to give your images different names so that you dont get confused when coding.
