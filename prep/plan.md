|David C| i liked the way u introduced your astronomy topic in your overview by adding a drop down that includes why u chose this as your topic.| i think u shoukd work on adding colors like purple and blue because those colors go along with your topic(imo)
|Joshua K| you did a really good job at centering your cards because thats something i found challenging while working on my own website.| u can work on making your website a bit more lively because atm it looks very bland and i think u could use one more carousel for your innovention.
|Aaron W|u glowed by adding your game to your website and linking it as a button.| something u should do in order to help u grow is adding fun facts and quizing the player on things about our solar system.
|Ala|I liked your carousel at the begining of your website because it introduced cool facts about the planets in our solar system and its planets.| something you could work on is the sizing of your images because the different sizes throw me off a bit.
|Farzona|i liked how you added the drop down component with the reasons why u chose astronomy as your topic and the way that wrote your overview about your website.| u should fix the navbar because it doesnt link to the game yet.
|derrick|i liked how u fixed the gradient of your cards in order to make them stand out for your facts and software as well as hardware.| u should find better images that arent so pixilated for your website!
