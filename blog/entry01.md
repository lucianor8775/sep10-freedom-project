# Entry 1: Deciding On A Topic
##### 10/7/24

### Choosing my Topic
The topic that i chose for the freedom project is astronomy. i chose astronomy because it is something that i have always found very facinating, interesting, and has been something that i have always liked learning about. beforing making up my mind on the my topic i had two other chocies, these two other chocies were law and philosophy. a website that made me consider doing law as my project topic is https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/the-law.page because it has a lot of information and explaniations on NewYork state law. a website that made  me consider doing philiosophy as my topic is https://philindex.org/about-us/ because it has publications from philiosophers that date back to the early 1900Â´s and because the publications come from many different countries and languages. overall these websites were all very intersting but i ended up choosing astronomy because of the https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/astronomy/what-is-astronomy website. the reason i found this website so interesting and chose astronomy as my topic is because this website teaches a lot about astronomy and it is very interactive and a useful tool when doing reasearch.

### Engineering Design Process
I am on the first stage of the engeneering design process, which is figuring out my topic and trying to figure out how i am going to slove the main problem that my project hopes to solve, which is to help more people understand and become interested in astronomy. The next step in the engineering process is to do more reasearch on my topic by looking at websites and articles, to start my informational website on astronomy.

### skills
A skill that i have learned since starting this project is how to read, reading is a skill that i better developed since starting this project because i have learned how to pay closer attention to detail and to re read articles, as well as reading the descriptions on websites instead but skimming paragraphs and not paying close attention to details like i did prior to starting this project. Another skill that i have learned since starting this project is time managemnet, time management is another skill that i have developed since starting this project because of the fact that i have had to make time outside of school to work on this blog, project and classwork and doing all of this involves having to manage time outside of school.

### summary 
I am very excited to start working more on the freedom project because i love learning about astronomy and doing my own research to teach more poeple about the subject.
