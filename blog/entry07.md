### Content
This month i presented my website on astronomy to a lot of people periods 1-2 as well as during 8th period and a few things to takeaway from my elavator pitch are to sum up all my important key points in an understandable and organized manner because if you dont then itll drive people away from your presentation and they wont understand what you want to say. a few things that i have taken away from my in class presentation with my classmates is to take my time with my presentation and to give takeaways and explain my process and to also look at my aduience while speaking because something that i didnt do so well was looking at my class and taking time with my explainations.
