# Entry 2: next steps
##### 10/4/2024

### Context
I am a student at HSAT and i ampreparing to begin the freedom project in my SEP class. the freedom project is year long project i am going to be working on that show cases a lot about my topic (astronomy). since my first blog i have been doing a lot of research about the different types of technology that is used in the field of astronomy. i have learned a lot about the different types of apps and programs that astronomy have an example of this is the world wide telescope. the world wide telescope is a website that allows the user access to a lot of images that space probes take of celestial objects.

### Content
A few of the apps i found include [solar walk](https://vitotechnology.com/apps/solar-walk), [starry night](https://www.starrynight.com/starry-night-8-professional-astronomy-telescope-control-software.html), and, [skyview](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skyview-lite/id413936865). I found these apps by searching "what type of apps do people in astronomy use?" and "astronomy apps". Solar Walk is a 3D planetarium in your device that has a model of the Solar system that shows you the planets, satellites, and other space objects. the user can navigate through space and see all the planets close-up, and you can also learn their trajectories, composition, surface temperature, and so much more. Starry night is a software that uses OpenGL and Quick Time to show a photo realistic night sky. It also provides telescope control. Skyview costs 1.99 and has a free version available, it has little telescope control an AR star map, easily accessible info, the constellation art fades too quickly, and it is not as detailed as other apps, but it is avaliable on the app store and can be used on mobile.

### Sources
A lot of sources that i have used this unit include:
* [astronomy software](https://astronomyonline.org/AstronomySoftware.asp) is a website that includes a lot of different software programs and apps, the website also includes a lot of information about the apps.
* [stargazingapps](https://www.space.com/best-stargazing-apps) Is an article that i used in order to collect info about apps. this article ranked the apps from best to worst and was very useful to me when i was doing my research on apps.
* [astronomyonline](http://astronomyonline.org/Science/Equipment.asp#:~:text=Telescopes%20and%20radio%20dishes%20are,of%20filters%2C%20photometers%20and%20spectrometers.) this website helped me a lot when learning more about astronomy, an example of something that i have learned using this website is that Telescopes and radio dishes are used from the surface of the Earth to study visible light, near infrared light, and radio waves. From space, astronomers use special telescopes to study X-ray and gamma ray emissions.
* [science nasa](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/observatory/design/instruments/0) was another website that has helped me when it came to doing more research on astronomy, something that i have learned about from this webiste is, Installed on Hubble in 2002, ACS was designed primarily for wide-field imagery in visible wavelengths, although it can also detect ultraviolet and near-infrared light. ACS has three cameras, called channels, that capture different types of images.

### Engeneering design process
i am currently in my second stage of the engeneering design procres. i did my reasearch on my topic and i looked up apps and program that had to do with astronomy. The next stage in my EDP is to merge all of my research and start working on my actual freedom project website.

### Skills 
a few skills that i gained were how to google and how to read better.

#### googling
i learned how to google by putting in specific words when searching for something specific. an example of this would be if i was searching for "good cat beds", if i was searching for" good cat beds" i would search "best cat beds" instead of the word "good" because u could find a lot of more different viarity and better products when using key words, like "best" instead of "good.

#### reading
another skill that i gained was reading. reading was another skill that i gained, because when doing research in the past i would often skim and not throughly read everything that i had in font of me and that became very inconvenient, because i would sometimes miss important information. after doing my research for the freedom project i learned that the more i read through websites the more information i would get and the faster it was to get my work done and get all the information i needed.
