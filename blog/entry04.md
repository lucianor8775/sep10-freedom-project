# Entry 4: A-frame
#### 2/24/25

### Content
I have decided to use A-frame, because i like the fact that it is used in a lot of things like VR, another reason that i have decided to use A-frame is because i find the animation and style very interesting. One way that i tinkered with A-frame was by creating a forest with a cabin. I used the original code to guide my code by analyzing it and learning from it. I tried to play around with code to see what I would like, and I eventually ended up with a forest and a cabin.

### Tinkering
my code for a tree
```bash
<a-cylinder position="-2.5 1.50 -5" radius=".2" height="3" color="#8B4513"></a-cylinder>
 <a-sphere position="-2.5 3 -5" radius="1.2" color="#228B22"></a-sphere>
```
code for my cabin
```bash
<a-box position="0 0 -3" width="4" height="0.1" depth="3" color="#8B4513"></a-box>
<a-box position="-2 1 -3" width="0.1" height="2" depth="3" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
<a-box position="2 1 -3" width="0.1" height="2" depth="3" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
<a-box position="0 1 -4.5 -3" width="4" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
<a-box position="0 1 -1.5" width="4" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#D2691E"></a-box>
<a-cone position="0 3.5 -3" radius-bottom="3" radius-top="0" height="3" color="#A52A2A"></a-cone>
<a-box position="0 0.5 -1.4" width="1" height="2" depth="0.1" color="#8B4513"></a-box
```

### Sources
A few sources that helped me learn were [A-frame](https://aframe.io/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) The **A-frame website** helped me learn by giving me starter code and an introduction to A-frame. **Youtube** helped me by explaining the code and by teaching me how to create certain things. 

### Engineering Design Process
I am currently trying to work with my tool and I am trying to figure out how to build and create new things using it. My plans for the next stage of my freedom Project are to
* develop my A-frame skills
* make a VR immersion with A-frame
* find textures
  I plan on using A-frame a lot in my Freedom project.
   I want to be able to make a very immersive experince that people can use and interact with.

### Skills
A few skills that I have developed are **attention to detail and how to research**. I developed the skill of attention to detail by watching videos, paying close attention to code and by changing/adding new things to it. I developed the skill researching by putting keywords into the search engine and by remebering important ideas that could be helpful when it comes to coding.
