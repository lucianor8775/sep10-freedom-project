 ### Content 
I have written and done my research on my project topic. My project will be about an immersion experience that includes an app that has all information available about space using a kind of software that gives the user access to all the databases/information about space ever recorded. I brainstormed part B of my project by adding the big ideas, being my astronomy space room and then i wrote multiple small details that my main idea will have. I finalized all of my content so that it is realy for my website by organizing all of my notes and categorizing them based on the most information that i can get.

 ### Sources 
In order to find and gather all my information i had to use multiple sources so that i could build both my part A and part B of my notes. these where my sources:
* [NASA](nasa.gov)
