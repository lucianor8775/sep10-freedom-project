# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Luciano Rita**

## Context
I am Luciano Rita, a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Astronomy**. I chose the topic of astronomy because its not widely known about and its something that i find very interesting. In my website i included things such as hardware, software, a model of our solar system and a future innovation that all directly had to do with things in the feild of astronomy. The goal of my website was to educate others about astronomy in a fun and interactive type of way which i hoped to achieve by adding things like buttons and quick fun facts about the things we have in our solar system.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **A-frame** in order to help me make my website.
