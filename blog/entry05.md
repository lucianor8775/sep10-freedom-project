# Entry 5: A-frame
##### 4/11/25

# Content
I have been learning how to use A-frame for some time in order to use it in my freedom project about astronomy. I have learned how to add texture, add audio, and i have been able to achieve a lot through this and it has helped me get an idea of what i want my freedom project to contain and look like. Even though i have had a hard time figuring out the code i was still able to figure out a large majority of  the code thanks to classmates, youtube, and the A-frame website itself. With the code that i have learned i was able to a sphere with an earth like texture that makes a noise whenever you press it.
