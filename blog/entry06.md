## Content
I made my MVP by looking at the website requirements and my Wire frames. I had the idea to add a carousel, cards and a collapse but i did not arrange them the same way i had it on my wireframe because i realized that i wanted to add more last minute. A few takeawys i had while making my MVP were that i should view the requirements before making the wireframe to make sure the layout of your website makes sense, and to give your images different names so that you dont get confused when coding.

## Challenges
Something that was challenging while making my MVP was Linking my model of our solar system onto my website.
this is what the code looked like when it wasnt linked to my model.
```bash
 <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="#game" target="_blank">Game</a>
```
All that was needed to do in order to link my wesbite was to literally insert the link of my pickcode into the code.
This is what it looked like once it was fixed
```bash
 <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="https://app.pickcode.io/share/cmb0xfko7fnw38qty38l0anql" target="_blank">Game</a>
```
This was a challenge for me because in previous projects i had not been the one to code the navabr.

Another thing that i found complicated include

### EDP
I am almost done with my website and i am now starting to finalize my code for my solar system model. I plan to update some of the images of my website and fixing a few other things like colors and fonts. I plan to update some of my images by looking up more detailed images and then plugging them into my code. I plan to fix my colors and fonts by using CSS in order to create classes that apply to certain bits of text.

### Skills
A few skills that i have gained thus far include research and independence. I have gained the skill of research by studying and looking up key words when looking for specific things about code and astronomy. Another skill i learned is the skill of independence which i gained by doing my own research and practing on my own and looking for ways to fix things that i found complicated on my own.
